I think that there is no one who does not know the AMIDEWIN method. Do not try to install 2 hours on usb and boot from the bios. It works for most people. It works for most people. It does not work for most people. Even when it works, we see that vanguard still bans it. What this program does is a spoofer now. Normally, the program is paid but we have a foreign friend named "Apidute". He scribbled it and shared it. I am using it, there is no problem for now. Anyway, I'm telling you what to do.

First of all, close vanguard from the bottom right of the windows bar.
Run CMD as administrator and type these two commands in order;
- sc delete vgc
- sc delete vgk

Then go to the uninstall program section of the control panel and remove anything related to valorant or vanguard.
Go to the location where you installed valorant and delete all valorant files.
Then restart your computer.
NOTE: I recommend you to format directly, but still, you know, I am telling you for friends who do not work.

Now let's come to our spoof process. We download our "Lydian Spoofer" from the link I gave below. Run the program.
!!! It will ask you for a license key. You can pass by not typing anything there or you can write something in your head. Since the program is cracked, it will not be a problem !!!.
